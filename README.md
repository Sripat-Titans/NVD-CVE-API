Project Description
Introduction:
The CVE Information Management System is a comprehensive solution designed to consume, store, cleanse, and analyze Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) data provided by the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) via its API. The system ensures data quality, periodic synchronization, and provides APIs for easy access and filtering of CVE details. Additionally, it offers a user-friendly web interface to visualize CVE information and interact with the system.

Key Features:
Consumption of CVE Data from NVD API:
The system consumes CVE information from the NVD API (BaseURL: https://services.nvd.nist.gov/rest/json/cves/2.0) using a series of smaller chunked responses controlled by an offset startIndex and a page limit resultsPerPage.
Data Storage and Management:
MySQL database (utilizing phpMyAdmin) is used to store the CVE information.
Data cleansing and de-duplication techniques are applied to ensure data quality and integrity.
Periodic Synchronization:
CVE details are synchronized into the database periodically in batch mode, either through full data refresh or incremental refresh for modified data alone.
API Development:
APIs are developed to read and filter CVE details based on various parameters such as CVEID, CVEIDs belonging to a specific year, CVSS Score, and last modified date in N days.
User Interface:
A user-friendly web interface is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to visualize CVE information and interact with the system.
API Documentation:
Comprehensive documentation is prepared for each API operation, detailing the endpoints, parameters, and expected responses.
Unit Testing:
Well-defined unit test cases are written to validate the functionality of different system components, ensuring reliability and correctness.
Code Quality and Security:
The code adheres to best practices and standards, ensuring clarity, vulnerability-free implementation, and adherence to security guidelines.
Conclusion:
The CVE Information Management System provides a robust platform for efficiently managing CVE data, ensuring data integrity, accessibility, and usability. By leveraging the NVD API, MySQL database, and modern web technologies, the system offers a seamless experience for both administrators and end-users in accessing and analyzing CVE information.
